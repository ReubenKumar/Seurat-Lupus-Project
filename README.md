# ðŸ§¬ Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus (CLE) Single-Cell RNA-seq Analysis

ðŸš§ **Project in progress**

This project analyzes **10x Genomics 3' single-cell RNA-seq data** from patients with **Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus (CLE)** â€” a chronic inflammatory skin disease. The dataset includes skin tissue samples from three groups:
- **Healthy skin**
- **Non-inflamed CLE-affected skin**
- **Inflamed CLE-affected skin**

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

- **Identify distinct cell types** present within the samples using the Seurat R package
- **Discover differentially expressed genes (DEGs)** between the different skin conditions and examine cell counts between conditions.

---

## ðŸ“„ Contents

- **`Lupus.md`** â€” Contains the RMarkdown script and results, including:
  - Code for processing and analysing the scRNA-seq data
  - Plots and visualisations for cell type identification and clustering
  - Supporting commentary and interpretation of the results

---

## ðŸ“Œ Notes

- The analysis workflow uses the **Seurat** R package for single-cell data processing, normalisation, clustering, and visualisation.

---

## ðŸ“¦ Requirements

- R (version â‰¥ 4.x)
- Seurat (version â‰¥ 5.x)
- dplyr, ggplot2, and other tidyverse packages
